# Static Equilibrium of a Double Wishbone Suspension


The objective of this notebook is to give a quick review on how the static equilibrium can be solved for a double wishbone suspension. This can be used to decompose forces at the contact patch throught the suspension members, which is usefull for posterior finite element and load path analysis, for example. I hope you enjoy it.
